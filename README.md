This project provides a quick installation of open source data products, allowing anyone to try them out without investing significant time in setup. It supports both local and AWS-based deployments, making it easy to experiment with modern data tools.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to automate the deployment of popular open source data platforms (Airbyte, Metabase, Authentik, Postgres, and more) using simple scripts and infrastructure-as-code. Whether you want to run everything locally or on AWS, setup is fast and straightforward.
